# Memory-Assisstance
## Introduction:
Amnesia is a condition characterized by the inability to remember certain events or information. Amnesia caused by neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affects many elderly people. In the United States, it is estimated that around 5.8 million people have Alzheimer's disease. Amnesia patients face several difficulties in remembering people, places, events, to do things etc. So, MEMORY ASSISSTANCE aims to develop a comprehensive tool for individuals suffering from amnesia. It will utilize facial recognition technology to assist in identification, as well as incorporate interactive games and music therapy to improve memory retention. Memory albums and a daily diary feature will also be included to aid in recollection of past events. Additionally, a to-do list feature will be incorporated to assist with daily task management. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of life for amnesia patients using technology.
